# FashionMNIST CNN Classifier

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items, such as T-shirts, sneakers, and coats.

## Dataset

- Source: [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)
- 10 classes
- 60,000 training images, 10,000 test images
- Grayscale, 28x28 pixels

## Model

- Basic CNN architecture
- ReLU activations and max pooling
- Fully connected layers leading to a 10-class softmax output

## Results

- Achieved ~XX% test accuracy (fill in your result)
- Shows solid performance for a simple baseline model

## How to Run

```bash
# Inside the fashionmnist/ folder
jupyter notebook cnn_fashionmnist.ipynb
